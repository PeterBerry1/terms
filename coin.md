# Daily rewards
To redeem your free daily rewards, you can use the command `daily` where MoonPool-V1 will reward you, when the day pass.

# Inviting people
You can earn coins by creating a invite-link and inviting people to the server.

For every person that joins, MoonPool-V1 will give you 25 coins.

When you create a Invite-Link on our server, discord will let us see everyone that created Invite-links on our server.

Discord will let us know, how many people joined from your invite-link and if you are the one that created the invite-link.

Since we can know, if you created the invite-link, this will be used to prevent others from redeeming your coins by using your invite-links.

Here is how to redeem your coins, after you manage to get people to join from your invite-link and want to redeem your coins.

The command `invite-claim https://discord.gg/AoajOwknI` where you replace https://discord.gg/AoajOwknI with your invite-link instead, and now when you send this to MoonPool-1, MoonPool-1 will check how many people joined from your invite-link, and give you 25 coins for how many people that joined from your invite-link.
